# Calculator
This is a Calculator developed fully in Python using Tkinter for GUI
A Calculator as we all know is a simple device used to carry out mathematical calculations. 
But all the calculators available in the market are either provided with too less buttons or more than required by average user in daily uses. 
There is no balance for a calculator with just the right functions needed on a single screen.
This Calculator is made keeping same thing in mind i.e. to provide only those buttons which are of regular use. 
This prevents the user from being overwhelmed by too much buttons as well as helps him to get all the buttons as and when needed. 
This project was made after a short survey to decide which buttons people actually need in their day to day activities.
So basically this calculator is a combination of simple and scientific calculator. 
This Calculator is simply the most optimal calculator which we can present for proper use.
